# Product-Demand-Prediction
## ML Decision Tree Regressor Model for Product Unit Sales Prediction
This Python project is focused on predicting product unit sales using a machine learning decision tree regressor model. The project utilizes popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn (sklearn). The objective of this project is to build a decision tree model that predicts the units sold of a product based on its total price and base price.

The dataset used in this project consists of product data, including the product ID, store ID, total price, base price, and units sold. The dataset contains information on various products sold in a store, and the data has been collected over a period of 30 days.

Project Goals
The goals of this project are to:

Explore the product dataset and gain insights into the product unit sales trends
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis
Train a decision tree regressor model to predict the units sold of a product
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics
Visualize the model results using various plots and charts to better understand the data
Technologies Used
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: for numerical operations and calculations
Matplotlib: for data visualization
Plotly: for interactive data visualization
Seaborn: for data visualization
Scikit-learn: for building and evaluating machine learning models
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Cleaning: This section includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps such as removing missing values, handling outliers, and converting data types.
Data Analysis: This section includes analyzing product unit sales trends and preparing the data for training the decision tree regressor model.
Model Training: This section includes training the decision tree regressor model using the cleaned and prepared data.
Model Evaluation: This section includes evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Data Visualization: This section includes creating various plots and charts to better understand the data and visualize the results of the decision tree regressor model.
Conclusion
This project provides an opportunity to analyze product unit sales trends and build a decision tree regressor model that predicts the units sold of a product based on its total price and base price. By using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, we can effectively analyze and visualize the data, train the decision tree regressor model, and evaluate its performance. The project results can be used to optimize product pricing strategies and increase unit sales.
